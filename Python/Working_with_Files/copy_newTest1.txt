Hmm this is a problematic one because I can't seem to reproduce the issue on Linux. I will try to reproduce it on Windows. If I successfully reproduce the issue on my machine I will update the README.md, Is there a snippet that you think woud be a suitable replacement? Unfortunately the one with paths_only=True isn't really a good solution as it will cause the underlying images to be deleted on the context exit which in the turn will raise more issues when the user tries to open them.
